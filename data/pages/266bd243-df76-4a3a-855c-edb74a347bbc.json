          "text": "Frank and Marcos de Leon had very different memories of certain experiences from their childhoods. While both men discuss how much their community changed over time, Frank does not recall the things that caused this change, like the construction of I-35, as having much of an effect on him, while Marcos recalls in detail how it caused certain institutions, like the church building his mother helped to found, to disappear. Frank also doesn’t think that his childhood was very political, while Marcos was aware of and involved in politics like the Chicano Movement, a Mexican American Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and 70s, from a young age and continues to be politically involved today. Still, the men’s oral histories provide rich, vivid detail about what life was like for Mexican American children in the mid 20th century. They remember Palm fondly, and give insight into why the Mexican American community is working to preserve it today."
