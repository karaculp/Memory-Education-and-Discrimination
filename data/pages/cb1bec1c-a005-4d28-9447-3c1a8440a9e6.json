It was populated mostly by black and hispanic residents at the time the de Leons lived there, and continues to have higher populations of black and hispanic residents than the rest of Austin today. This is the legacy of Austin City Council’s 1928 plan, which was a housing plan to intentionally segregate all black residents (and eventually Mexican American residents) to the area east of East Avenue, the future I-35. The discriminatory housing practices which created this segregation can be seen in this map of Austin from 1934, which depicts “Redlining” a practice banks and realtors engaged in by assigning value to certain neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. In the map, East Austin is marked mostly as “Definitely Declining” or “Hazardous.”"
