That's the area where Lytton Springs, like five miles from Lockhart and the\nstory goes, this is urban legend.

Probably they kept ,been through being, we know it Ben White/ 71 they came in from Lockhart, and they got stuck. And in the 1920s our people live in West Austin, west of Congress: Lavaca, Colorado. See these streets? They're in Spanish? So they threw the Model T 4 over the bridge into the water. So they hiked the rest of the way into what they called back then the man was called me, kind of “little Mexico”, or Mexico, which on 2nd and Brazos, 2nd and Colorado, where the city council used to be at. There's where he started. My mother came from Bastrop. From family from Bastrop. It wasn't until 1946 that they met, he was living by himself, worked for the city, and she was divorced had four kids, and my uncle Gray, told my father, “and there's a woman who has four kids. If you marry her before the year is over, you get some tax credits.” (Laughter). The problem with my father. He fell in love with my mother. They met, they got married in april of 1946 so that's before the December for the taxes came. He married 1946 on April the 30th. And Mace B. Thurman. He was a JP, and later he became a judge, a district judge, and I had the chance to shake his hands and thank you for marrying my parents. And he says, “Commissioner, look what I created.” (Laughter) People take credit for stuff like that. That's my mother and my father. My father, Franciso. I always introduce myself. Who are you? Says, I'm the son of Francisco \"Frank\" De Leon and Marianna Armoda Garcia de Leon. That's who the son that I am."

And that's when I first moved to Palm when I lived on 8th Street and then third grade, we moved to Rainey Street, and we stayed there until the 11th grade. Till my father had a heart atta- a stroke, and we couldn't afford we couldn't afford to stay there, so we moved to 11- 1102 Haskell Street, and I finished high school when I lived on Haskell street, but that's where my family came from."

This is the story. This is the pastor. You gotta believe, the Pastor. Pastor. Anyway, the Pastor said. “We heard some crying, and we found her in a stable, in this property on East 3rd Street and I-35. “Por qué estas llorando?” why are you crying? She said “No, no estoy triste, estoy tomando aire”, “Por qué?” “Porque aquí vamos a poner la Iglesia.” \"Because I'm happy, because we're going to put the church here,” brother, Brother Paredes. He's her brother, “Aquí vamos estar”. And so they, they bought the land because they used to be under the basement at the First Baptist Church on 8th Street. Still there, still there, First Baptist Church still on 8th Street. And they were at the basement because, hablando puro español, it was a Spanish Baptist Church. No, no hablan ingles. And so this is it. And then we're there for years, until 1960 when the highway came, so they moved down to Brushing. Now they're over there on Ben White Boulevard. There. Church still there. And the original Bapt- first Mexican Baptist Church is still in Bastrop, built in 19- started 1908 it was finished in 1924 it's called the “Primer Iglesia Baptista” the first Mexican Baptist in Bastrop of Texas. And we visited, and we put our names that we added our names to it. They were happy to find out that we were still alive. (Laughter) And still around!"

So the gabachos, the white guys, used to call because we used to bring tortillas with cheese, and they say, look, “there\ngo the three blind mice.” When all three of us were in school, we all had little paper bags. We had tortillas they call quesadillas. They just cost less than a dollar but they'll charge you .75 for a quesadilla. it's real funny to us, but anyway, but I remember they used to cause us “the Three Blind Mice” because we had cheese, right? Yeah, interesting. We didn't eat in, I didn't eat into the cafeteria that I was in the\nfourth grade. Hildebrandt, which I know is it was at Palm school. The principal first of Mr. Boyd, one day we were not going to school, and he looked for us, and he found out we thought we just had nothing to\neat. We just couldn't get into school. So he let Mr. Hildebrandt got us free lunch or a nickel, it cost a nickel to get lunch. And I remember one time, “because tu comas tortilla con puro mano”, eat with your\nhands. So that I was in the third grade eating, eating the food again, with my bread getting like a tortilla. And then one little girl said, “Marcus is dirty. He's eating with his hands. I don't want sitting next to him.” I remember that."

Going to school the first year my limited Spanish, there were a lot of Anglos still, it was an Anglo school mix, from the early times. I think in the 40s, they started, lotta Mexicanos started moving to the neighborhood. By '54 there were a lot of us. In the 30s they were, but I think by '54 there were a lot of us, that were really mixed. There were no blacks. It was a segregated school. No blacks were allowed to come. Because I had black friends on 8th Street and said, “we got our own school, Marcus. We go to John P, we go to Sims and Blackshear. We have our own school.” I said, “Well, how come we don't have one?” So I noticed that. And by I guess the third, third, fifth grade, it was primarily Raza. And I think my wife did a research with a law student, and the data that she had showed in 1954 to 1960 the Anglo community moved out of the neighborhood because they didn't want to- It was the brown- It was I went to school when the Brown versus the Board of Education, to be Kansas, Oliver Brown was daughter was not allowed to go to school, so he filed suit. Thurgood Marshall took the lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court, and they voted that it was unequal and school should not be segregated. So according to the data, the Anglos fear that the black kids were coming to Palm and to Metz, because Metz with other schools all Anglo, because Zavala was a Mexican school and Metz was the Anglo school. So I think the fear of integration, a lot of Anglo community members moved to West Austin, North Austin, and went to- to at that time, Jollyville, which is Cedar Park now, and Round Rock, and then moved out of the neighborhood. So by the time I was in sixth grade, it was almost all Chicano."

He had a mask on, and I had everybody do the… and I was the victim. They loved it! But somebody told Dr Paredes, my pastor. “Marquitos!” And then one time was square dance, that was there were square dances as part of P.E. and I loved it, and I was square dancing up a storm. And somebody told Pastor Paredes and church in the morning, “Marquitos, come here, estabas bailando? You were dancing?” “Who!?’ “Oh, so and so told me you were square dancing, que you were the best.” Of course, I love dancing. So that was the some of conflicts I grew up with. And then what's the dancing? It's indigena. It's in us. And why we go Chicano dancing. We go in circles. We're doing, we're doing with 1000s of years of dancing going in circles. People like Irish people dance in circles. Indigenous people from Europe do this similar that we do. So it's part of us, and that's the two worlds."

And you don't want to go to the underworld. You want to go to the spirit world. And I think you understand the heart of being the creator, and wondering, how? who does that? You know, I can do it on a on a paper, I can draw red, but how was that created? It's just like, there's no explanation to talk there's just a feeling that you have inside this. There's something's great out in the world that can do stuff like this, you just get, Oh, It’s just a red bird? No! Well, how is it red? You know, there's gotta be something there that creates these things. When people talk about the Creator, when you think about people talk about God and Jesus and all that, and create these things, it was the\nsame way as an Indigenous person, understanding Mother Earth, understanding what she does, that she's alive, and how that- it's in it's in me. I can't get it out. I, you know, I don't believe in Jesus. That is\nsomething I don't have. You know, among our people, we know this is Jesus, we know he came. We know he walked the earth. But. Uh, if he just his teachings, you be okay. But if you go beyond that,\nyou're not okay, because you become very repressive. You're telling me, because I believe in ceremonies, because I believe in the Creator, then these are my protections. These are these. These\nare here to protect me against spirits. This is where my world, this was given to me by an elder, because I'm an elder now it's to protect me. But someone said, \"No, that's paganism,\" right? I don't\nbelieve that. And if you believe Jesus, good, I'm glad! It's no problem. That's I think the way I went, I think that helped me in my activism and the things that I do, and the gift is like you, the guy in the\ncamera, the Creator gave him that gift because that's what he does. He's good at it, yeah, here, Dr. Cortez, that's who you are. The gift is given to you. The gift that I was given is to what I just explained\nto you is in Palm School, even though I flunked another year, there were a lot of practice that I worked at Palm School that got around a lot of kids and resolved conflicts with my students- my fellow students,\nand that stayed with me forever. So I was 60 years old when I realized, Hortensia told me. She said, “that's your gift.” “What do you mean? I don't understand.” “There are people fighting each other, and\nthey ask you to come in, and next thing you know, they're all working together. How do you do it?” “I don't know.”"

So we became the Crusaders when we played church league because they didn't want to play us as the Red Devils. Those some of the names we had. And then there were different names. But let me give you the names of the ball players: White Out, Tippie Toes, Golgas, Hamburger and Treadwell."

Haha when you, one of the things that the Salvation Army, not only was Salvation army were involved here in the Barrio on Holly street, but the Salvation Army was part of life when it was on 5th Street, when they used to be on 5th Street, and they had a center there, and that’s where you could get shoes. So they gave away free shoes, gratis. But they didn't last the whole year. By the time you came back, January, April, they started coming apart. So when you got Salvation Army shoes, you know, you were poor, but the Salvation Army, known it gave food and turkeys and stuff were involved in that. They were very helping. And then right across the street from Palm was the awesome brotherhood with the church. Was the Baptist Church where the Juarez Lincoln was, and that was a brotherhood. And Hortensia and my mother in law did a lot of work. They took in alcoholics, homeless people, but they also saw the Barrio gave out food and dinners and Christmas stuff."

They were all together, Jacobs and and anyway, Sam Altra was newspaper worth the Driskill hotel on the back side, where they had with the white pharmacy, and we picked up a couple of Baby Ruths, and Sam Altra caught us. We were, I was about nine, and Sam Altra caught us that summer. “What are you boys doing? What you got in your bucket? Did you pay for it?” “No”, “put it back. I'll give you a job.” So we put the stuff back. He came back, guys says he gave us each two newspaper, two papers, American Statesman. He said, “you sell them for a nickel, you come back with a dime, and I give you four. So you two for one, and then then you come back and keep that extra nickel.” So that's how I started selling newspaper. American Statesman is by Sam Altra. Took us out and said, “You don't have to steal you make money. You can buy it.” So I had people, and that's one thing about that. I always have people who taught me lessons, but the same way that I talk was, without any violence without any harsh words, without I didn't need putting a person down. He said, “You guys, what you're doing is wrong. You want money to buy that here. Won't you do this and you have money.”"

But it said, why don't we create a school and takes kids from Allan, which\nis was, at that time, in 1960s was a predominant Chicano school, and O. Henry was a predominantly white school, Junior High Middle School, and John B Wynn was generally black. You take students from each one and bring them to Austin to UJH, in other words, get kids will normally go to Allen, which I was going to go. Can go to UJH, which were closer to it than Allen. People win can come over here and\npeople from O. Henry they bussed, because they're way, you know, Lake Austin area to come to integrate in Junior high. So we became the very first integrated junior high, the full force. This is 67 this\nis almost what, 12 years after the 54 board of education versus Brown, and we were integrated. And it was hard, you know, it was hard for all of us, because we never went to school together. None of us\ndid. We didn't go with blacks. We were the Anglo so we knew what they were like, and the blacks didn't go to school, with either one of us with Chicanos or blacks? I mean, for whites, it was hard."

What it was is they had an annual powder puff flag football game between the girls and Janie was good. She had brothers. You know, she knows how to play football. No, I remember. Now. You remember what they did. They were boycotting they didn't want to play because they didn't allow her to be quarterback. They just want the Anglo girls to be quarterback. So they protested. So we joined them. We started wearing different socks. That was good for me, because I never had a good pair, but we joined them, and we started boycotting. We started wearing things in our socks, and they fighting at them. They realized the university realized they doing the same thing. They racist stuff. I was my first I remember, it's Junior High. I was like, in the seventh grade, and I remember we were all joining the girls. Yeah, we joined. We so we start protesting with them. It's a quiet protest, right? Just, just don't wear things. Like they want us to tuck in our shirts. We're, you know, we're pachuco, right? We wear shirts outside. Wear black stacey's and camisas we don’t tuck in the shirt, and we had to tuck in our shirt, so we showed up one day with a shirt, and we tuck and said, “Why do this?” “Because they won't let the brown Mexican girls play football”. And we just tuck the shirt, we tell them why why we had a shirts out so we wouldn't get kick out, that because they kick you out ofschool or they put you in detention, you know?"

And no, I know you don't know that if you go back in the 50s, “Jane run, Jane, see, Jane run,” right? Simple English, and the teacher would just not call me, you know, and like so I got my so I got my pencil. This is the first grade. And I just, I just tore up the book and they sent me to the office.

I said, because the teacher wouldn't call my name. You know, the Anglos got girls and guys got the called. I didn't get a call, and I wanted so bad, because I worked so hard to learn those two pages, and she didn't call on me. So I just so…. I was always I was like my father said I was always one.

Because of that, my teacher my second grade teacher Ms. Schulze, what I love very much. Who's passed, was my greatest teacher. She said, after she learned who I was, after she helped me, after we worked things out, because I was always disrupting her class. And one thing she said, Alright, let's go. And I said, “Where are we going?” This is the bell rang. So everybody go to lunch, “but you Marcus, gonna stay”. She walked up to me and she said, “Look. I said, I know you like to play around you prankster”. So she said, “You have to learn how to turn it on, turn it off. You got\ngood you're good kid. You can learn, you know. And I'm going to tell you why you were flunked.” I thought because of my grades and stuff, and Rob Morgan was dumber than I am. So he said it,\n“Marcus, I'm dumber than you. I got passed the seventh grade”. He said, “The Teacher flunked you because she felt you, you were not mature enough to go into seventh grade.” She said “You need to be\nanother year. And I think she must read the way you are. If you learn how to cut it off when it's too much, then I think you do better”. So I just want to do for you, when I say, Okay, that's enough. I'm not\ntalking about the whole class, I'm talking to you, and when I say that, I need you to behave. Can you do that?” And I thought, “Yes, ma'am, I can do that.” And that changed me."

Would you like to come work with me? I said, \"Well, my\ncan my friend Ramon, come with me?\" He was, I can't remember his last he was a friend of mine, and we ended up working together because her, his father did landscaping, so we ended up cleaning her yard. She learned… she paid us. She learned she taught me how to accept money and work. I don't have to steal. I don’t have to work in the streets. I can work for her and working for her. In the eighth, seventh grade, I was offered a job as a dish washer, so I already knew how to work. I already new the value of work in my labor. She taught me that. So that was was a teaching moment for me, but her spirit was there like mine. Because one time somebody threw an airplane, because we had old schools in the top was would be down so the hot air can get out, somebody threw an airplane to our class in middle of our studies, everybody got shocked. And we thought, normally, a teacher gets up and ah, she goes, you know, that person must was… she laughs. “I think that person thinks that's pretty cool, you know, throw an airplane,\" something like that. She goes, \"it's, it's no big deal. Just leave it there. Let's get back.” And we're like, wow, this different type of a teacher that doesn't bother what's important is our studies. Don't worry about that. Something that's cute."

I said I will come to school every day I will not miss the class, and I gave y'all a certificate, a perfect\nattendance, and you see her name the bottom, T Ruth Schutze, and I made that commitment to her. So that meant I couldn't act up. And I learned a lot from her that so I'm, I'm I'm, I had the label, late\nbloomer, and the I'm late because it took me 13 years to get out of primary school from the first of the 12th grade. Took routine …12 years to get my degree, from '67 to '79 and it took me 10 years to get elected public office from 80 to 1990 that's who I am. So I have a lot of patience, but I think, but with Palm School did my friends, and I try to follow them, and a lot of them did a lot, some of us, three of us\nwent to school to college, in '67 but I'm only one that survived. That completed it. I mean, I didn't complete it… I'm only one that I know that completed a degree. I don't know. I know Hernandez\ncompleted a degree but from my Barrio. Macias and Fernando Luna, I don't know. I don't think they finished. \"Do you know their first names?\" Fernando Luna, Isidro Macias. I don't know if they ever finished school. I know Tony Hernandez, the guy who got shot by, finished his degree, and he worked for Southwestern Bell. This is profound, I think I had the only thing I suffered is a Bueller effect, usually the movie Bueller. Remember that scene? He said, Bueller, Bueller, when he skipped the professor could say that happened to me, spider, Orestina, a good friend was in math class, and the math teacher kept saying, Marcus De Leon, Marcus De Leon. And by Friday, he did this every day, and this is the first day Friday he says, Marcus De Leon, De Leon, because back then and junior high, you didn't use first names. It was our first name, De Leon, and Christina says, This is our this is my friend. So Christina got up and said, “Hey, what is it?” “Marcus, yeah, he flunked. That dummy. Flunk you're not gonna come here.” She's my best friend. So I don't know. I guess she was frustrated. Finally, later in life, got to meet and she told me, “but I'm so sorry. Marcus, I was just pissed off at the teacher. He should know you're not going to school. They should know that you're not coming.” But that's the only thing. When I saw that in the movie, ah, that's happened to me."

I love school, education, but my own way of never quitting. I started in '67 was married, had a kid, and I realized I had to raise and I had another kid. I had to go. I when I met Hortensia in '71 I was nothing. I'm going to school. And then she said, and then ACC was coming up. So we worked with a neighborhood. As a neighborhood, we supported ACC coming in, and she says, \"Why don't you go to once you register” This woman? You know, I hadn't Oh, I never passed English at CTC. I never passed freshman English. So in the summer of '73 I took it at HTU at Houston Civil University, and I passed it. And then she said, “why don't you go to school? Don't you register? You know? ACC”, “I don't know. I don't know”. So I registered. I am one of the 1772 students that first register at ACC. I'm also the one that 1000- 2000 students that registered CTC, because Central Texas College a brand new college in Killeen, Texas, and I was one of the first students. And then here I am again. She encouraged me to go to school. She was going to UT. You know, we had our first son, and she was\ngoing to UT, and she said, go to school. So I did, but it's too hard for two of us to go to school. So in '75 I dropped out of ACC. I said, let me put you to school. I'll work. They'll take care of our kid. You know, my other kids that I had. So I put her to school and I quit in '75. To me, as part of my training at Palm School, what I went to good things and bad things, bringing things out, facing yourself, and saying, what's the better thing to do? The better thing to do is to go to work full time and let her go to finish school, because she's smarter than me anyway. So she graduates '77 and she said, you know, why don't you go to school this fall? So I registered, well, the stuff that I did, ACC, I finished with a 3.5 I think GPA at ACC. So you know what? UT, did? They roll out the brown carpet for me? The students said, Mr. Daniel, you mean the red carpet. No, I'm a Chicano. They ran the brown carpet out for me. I was allowed to come in with nothing, do nothing, but come in. I had my GPA was so high. And my first year I was awarded the minority academic achievement award that invested for one year. That was it. But that I saw part, I think, what I talked to my students when I was a college advisor is you have your foundation and your parents, your families, your foundation, so where you go to school, where you play, what you do, in your community, in your Barrio, that's your foundation. So when you go to college, that's that's what you stand on, and that's what these journey beads were about, that I would give to them, that's what they stand on. This is what holds you together, and that's your foundation. So yeah, Palm School is our foundation. Every Elementary School is some kids who got to get to go a long time, that's their foundation. That's like the foundation of a house. It stands out. And then you go to high school, it gets built better. Then you go to college, and then when you graduate, you put your roof on, and you live your life, I think that's what the way I look at it. That's why Palm School is, it's so important."

              "text": "At Palm when I first went, we had our own sack lunch. And then by the third grade, we ate what the kids ate. It was good Fridays. Friday was great. Good pizza and weekly meatloaf. You always had\ngreens. I love greens. I'll eat the other kids' greens. Give it to me. Give me the green beans. Give me the squash. I will eat it well, because I'm starting half the time! But going to school, I wanted to always\nbe in there, but it was hard for me. Math was hard. English. I never learned English. Obviously, we'll tell you. We share with you one story about how I never learned English, even when I was to school. I was in the 10th grade, and I took an English class, and I was turning in hundreds, and then when I got my grade was a 'B.' I went to Mr. Ziegler, my report card, B, so I went to Mr. Zigler. I said, \"Mr. Ziegler,\" \"yeah, Marcus,\" \"can you? Can I… my test grades?\" because they have log books, 90, 100, 95 85, 100, 95 was it not an A, He says “I can't give you an A” I says, “why not? He says, “Because you… this class is a remedial class.” We no he said this, \"well, I can't let me, let me see a report card”. I showed my report card next to my name was a box and it was white out. He pulled his drawer out. Get a you know, a razor blade. He scratched all off the the white out, and there was an R there. \"See that R? Marcus. It means remedial.\" \"What does that mean?\" “Marcus, you know, I don't give you go, look it up”. You always do that. “Go, look it up.” What is it? How? What is it? “Go, look it up”. So I went to the library. And now many old library is 19, what? 65-64 anyway, big books open up and look up “remedial”. And, you know, at remedial when they read, they have a lot of words. One of the paraentheses said, “retarded.” That's all I remember. It said last then, or whatever. But right there in the middle was “retarded.” So I went back to my teacher, Mr. Ziegler, said, “get me out of here.” Said, “I don’t want to be here. This is going to follow me for the rest of my life. I don't want to be here. I'm not retarded. Or remedial.” He said, \"Well, Marcus you are going to struggle,\" “I know, I don't care”. So I got put back. Guess what I made my English, senior English, \"what?\" A “D”, really it was an “F” but Miss Hathaway was so proud of the way I worked, and I worked so hard she couldn't flunk me. She knew if she flunked me that I couldn't go to college. And D back in the 60s was okay. It's like a 69-70 so she put me a “D.” So when I went to college, I never passed English I. I finally did. But guess what? In 1979 when I was graduating, you go through all the stuff, they said, I need to take an English. I said “what?” I passed English one, “no, you took it at HT, we don’t accept Black English.” That's the exact words! They're not up to par with what UT has? I didn't understand that, and that's been something going on a lot with HBCUs. This is 1960s right? 70s. So guess what? I already graduated '79 but I had to take an English course during the summer here. And I was 33-34 years old, you know. And I'm with 16, 17,18, year old students."

Racist hotel?” “That racist hotel, the building here on 11th Street, right across from our neighborhood.” “What are you talking about?” “They ain't got no windows facing East Austin” I said, “You got to be kidding me”. “Marcus, need you and Paul and Francis need to be there. The consilio needs to be there.” “Okay, Francis, we'll be there.” So we show up. It's true. If you see the east wall of the, I don't know what's called now, I think it's a good night hotel or something. It used to be the Marriott, right on 11th Street, and IH 35 the windows, there are no windows facing East Austin. You know how hotels have windows all the way around, even in New York, I was standing at a Holiday Inn, and they were head forward, and you faced another hotel. It has no windows. It was the best thing you did because in the Marriott ended up giving said Jobs for Progress, to do all the hiring. I don't know, for just said Jobs for Progress, but GI Forum was a Mexican American organization. GI Forum, the one of their businesses, is set for, set for, set for, for jobs, and they appointed them to do all the hiring isn’t that great? A Chicano organization?"

The history was not our history. It was mainly Anglo history, and the Mexicanos\nwere, were losers. You know, the Alamo was very prevalent about that. But we did ask about Juan Seguin, they couldn't ignore that. To the, he helped Sam Houston to feed them Santana. So that was\nprominent, but there had to be more. But there wasn't. We learned about Juan Seguin that he helped win the revolution now, if you go the Alamo, now they have names on a lot of Mexicanos who fought at\nthe Alamo. And then now a historian, I forget his name. Uh. There's another battle that happened in Goliad that was run by Mexicanos. It was not Anglos. It was our people. We believe in freedom. But that's what we learned. It was not those Maypole celebrations. There was fourth of July celebration before school was out, there was about American history. The flag with the Pledge of Allegiance It was\nall Anglo history. Rarely anything Mexicano know anything, if it was Mexicano it was negative, like Santa Anna was a dictator, an emperor, trying to be free. And the Anglos, and we didn't know that people\nfought the revolutionary war in Texas, who fought other mexicano, who fought at the Alamo, the majority were from Tennessee, Kentucky, you know, Connecticut, New York, you know, from the Far East, as you call it. You say, anybody from New York and main from the Far East? (Laughter)"

And the church, some of the, some of the kids I went to school, went to my church too. And I remember them having parents, two parents. My father was a Catholico. He was raised a Catholic. So he would go to Guadalupe in the mananas, and then we made sure we were at the church by 10 o'clock, and he would go, and sometimes he would go to the church with us, but the men were over\nhere, Bible study, and then we were going to the church, he would sit with us. And I got baptized at that church after I got hit by car. I kid you not. Yeah, I got hit by car. Running to my school dude. I was so excited to get to school I got hit by a car."

This was in April. And then she said, I got some felt for y'all, and I chose green. He says, I need y'all to cover this box, cigar box, inside and out with this felt. I started work on it.

So by that time I was there that this students would still say, because we speak\nEnglish, they're sent to Zavala. That was the Mexican school, you know. They were not integrated, but Metz was our Anglo school. We have Metz. There you have Zavala, you have Palm, you know, schools,\nbut there were some were segregated, so we actually couldn't go, because we live so close to it that they, they allow us to go to Palm I was like eight blocks, when I walked. Always walked until I had the car\naccident, I was I always walked to school. We never, we never had a car. My father never drove a car.

She allowed me to lead some some prayer groups. Sometimes\njust lead the pledge of allegiance. I never got to lead the pledge of allegiance, only the anglos at first and later on, the smarter kids, you know. But Miss Schultz allowed me to do that. She gave me that. That was the most joy. I mean, I had fun when I was younger and struggled. In first grade, I struggled. Second grade, I struggled. Third grade, oh, it was horrible. \"Why?\" And in third grade, I had an old German teacher, Ms. Menn, M, E N N She was bad. I don't know why she didn't like me. She's guessing my pr…. jokes and stuff. That's been me since I was a kid. That's my personality that never going to that's never going to change. Two things happened. One, we had this cartoon about blood all caught, Disney made about my blood cells and how they travel, and I was to meet her like frijoles. So I was calling frijoles, beans, right? She got mad. She put me in a corner. Didn't see it, but I had a stick pin. So I put a stick pin on the map, and I was just looking into the map. So I gotta talk about it later. You, I choose the you. But the worst experience with her was during Christmas, and we're gonna exchange gifts. And by then, my first year, I didn't know about this, right? I didn't have anything, so I found this brand new toy they had, but it was a Jeep, 1949 Jeep with no wheels. So I wrapped it up and gave it to my Anglo friend, Ronald Bennet. Ronald Bennet was the only Anglo friend that I made friends that stay with me forever, even when I ran for public office, Ronald Bennet got my car. I'm so so bad. I got a coloring book (Laughter). Second grade. I found a coloring book and I thought I checked it. Nobody page. So I gave it to Yolanda. She gave it back to me. He says, \"this is, this was used\" One page. Someone, I cut a purple flower. I was totally embarrassed. Here's the third grade, Ms. Menn. Mean, teacher said, so I know she I didn't have, I didn't we didn't have anything. There's no way I could get a gift. So I think I had picked Christina's name. So I went back to miss min and said, Look, I don't have I can't get it to him. I don't have any. We're poor, you know. We just don't have it. My father said, Don't do it. So I told her, and she said, \"Who has Marcus De Leons name?\" Bent over, tore my name up, threw it in the trash. \"He's gonna give a gift to nobody. So I need to give this name somebody else.\" So she didn't do it well. So she gave. The guy, and looking someone said to my chair. \"Damn,\" I thought. So, his is a true story. Hector De Leon, who's not related, and I'll say his name because he knows, you know, maybe I shouldn't mention his name anyway, this guy said he that they had money, and he'll give me his gift. We're gonna celebrate the 20th of December. So the 20th shows up. He gets a knife, a plastic knife. This you can stab, but it goes inside the sheet. It's plastic, but you stab as a spring, and it just goes in your it goes inside the sheet, so it's no problem. So we're up and I remember Gutierrez was there, and he was with me and Rios, Frank, Leah, and he said, I went to get it now. He says, \"No, I changed my mind.\" He said, \"No, you said you were going to give me the present, your present, because you get a lot of presents.\" And then Rios, Guitierrez says, \"Yeah, you said you could, Marcus can have it.\" And I'm grabbing, and he's grabbing it back. I'm grabbing and he grabbing back, and then I hit him, hit him in the eye like this. Busted it. Bust his eye. You know, he's putting me. After Christmas, he and his mother show up at the school. Either was Christmas or the next day, his mother shows up, and what happened? Her son got beat up. Why did she take care of his man? His man said, \"It's him. It's him, It's Marcus.\" So I sat together with him, and she said, \"What? Why did you hit my son?\" Then I told the story, and she looked at her son, \"tell me the truth. Is that true?\" He goes, \"mmhm.\" You know what she did? She started to feed me and my brother after school, his mom invited us to come eat during the Christmas holidays. \"What was her name?\" I don't know. Just Ms. De Leon. I remember mother's name, but she invited us to eat, and we ate. We became friends. That's the story. But Ms. Menn, she would not support me or nothing, just would not."

You know why, right? \"Right?\" Because she my mother died during Christmas, so he wouldn't set, but he will give us some toy sometimes. My brother, Frank, older brother, convinced my father that we we can have a tree in our room, not in the living room. He didn't want, he didn't want those lights, he didn't want it to be remembered. So I know that my father fell in love with my mother. I know he loved her a lot because he never got remarried. So that's a Christmas story, the experience that I have that could, you know, traumatize the kid, but, ah, nah, nah. I just that. Just took it. I just because kind things happen. So, so you see what I'm growing got people I think I do bad things and think people are bad to me, but there's always somebody that's nice to me and says, \"Oh, don't worry about it. Okay, you're human being. Those things happen. There's some good in you. So we'll take that, then I show you some kindness,\" and when my students would graduate, and some are lawyers, some of them has a law firm. Some are doctors, some are nurses and teachers and stuff. What I always told my students, I said, “Do you want to thank me? Because they will say, Oh, we love you. Mr. De Leon, la la la.\" I said, \"Well, what I've done for you do for somebody else. Do not keep the knowledge that you have. Do not keep your experience that you have, share with other students, share with other people. And if you, if you ever make it, if you're a big falutin person, and you're walking in a hotel and someone opens the door for you, you say, thank you for opening your door. You have a great thank you for your job. Without you, I couldn't get in this building. And if you're asked to make a speech in any hotel or any restaurant or anything, the first thing you do, you say, let's give applause to the staff who clean this room for us, and this a wonderful room. Let's thank the people who's given us the food. Let's give them a clap. Then you honor who who asked you to come.” That's what I used to teach my students, because that's what I was taught."

Jerry it made Jerry real, Gerardo real mad, you know, we just cussed him out and walked out. That's when you felt it, you know. And because by then, most of the Anglos were gone, and most of, the few Anglos that lived in our neighborhood, like on Rainey street, they were nice people. They got on Garfield Street, they're very nice, and we just got along. But you begin to feel it. \"You're a Brown, you're a Mexican\". We would never called Americans they called us Mexicans. “Spics”, I have a poem about that. They call us, yeah, it's called “500 years.” \"They call us everything but human beings and what they call us “savages.” It was a “sausage”, then it was “spics,” “brownies,” “Greasers,” “wet backs,” all these names they call us, but they never call us human beings. But just imagine if we could share the beans with them. What would they call us? They'd have to call us human beings.\" It's a long poem, but that's the short of it."

I can't sing. I can't play an instrument, okay, all right. I can't compose anything, but I can dance. That I can do. So when I went to UJH, I wanted, I wanted foreign language, Spanish. “No ya se Espanol. I don’t need that.” But again, have Ms. Weber, not Ms. Weber, Ms. Weber. Does she? None? Thought so. and I lasted seven weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks. Nein. Nine. “You have a Mexican accent. That's not gonna work for German. Out of my class,” she threw me out. So I went and took Spanish with Ms. Newman. But I actually took German. Think about that. Why would I do that? Foreign language. I thought it would be so cool to learn it something totally different from mine. That's part a thing that I learned from Palm, all that learning that took empowerment, being diverse in my own self, and being open to different things that I think that's part of the nurture that I had in Ms Schulte telling me, go ahead, you know, go ahead and experiment that. And I took German as a language. And I can, I know how to count in German, say a few words. I wanted to take French, but they wouldn't let me. This is how you doing Spanish? Because I did terrible. I met a \"B\", barely a \"B,\" good. I spoke by then. I spoke slang. We put, we put a, we put on the board. I put on the board “te sales” T, E. She says, “What do you mean? Te sale.” And she goes, “who wrote te sale,” because you see it, s, a, l, e, and then Guiterez says “that’s ‘te sales’, you know what that means?” what “that you're out of bounds and you've been-\" it was terrible. It was by then, by time I was in junior high, “hey ponte trucha watche la jura.” Know what that means? “Be careful about the cops.” You know, we spoke like that. My Spanish was gone. It's all slang. It was all pachuco. I grew up in the Barrio."

              "text": "First, he looked like my father. (Laughter) He looked just like my father. And and he said something, “education is like a ratchet.” He said, “If you get educated, I got educated that how I know how to help my farm workers. It's like a ratchet. Once you push it, you can't pull it back. So education, the more education, the more like a ratchet, the more you get. And you can't, you're not going to lose it. You can't push it back because the ratchet works. You get locked. You're locked in that ticket.” That's- and that just kind of stayed in my mind. You know, that's one of his great sayings that people quote sometimes. And I understood that they made an impression on me. And Fernando Luna came to me and said, this a new college they been building: clean. I knew I wasn't going to get accepted anywhere here, like I tell my students later, I told my my students who were going to college, says “I was the top 25 my class.” “Oh, really? Mr. De Leon, what were” “of the Cs!” they go?” Whaaa!”, you know, because that was true because I wanted to go to school. I didn't want to go to Vietnam. I could have gone in the Air Force. I could have gone like my brother, and avoided going into the army or whatever. But I wanted to go to school. This man said, that's, that's the best thing you can do for yourself. It stuck in my head. So Fernando said, \"let's go. I got my father's 1950 Pontiac. Let's get out there.\" So we hit it out there, and we got into college in the fall of 1967. So, those things influence me, and that was political. The word “Chicano” like it says “Chicano power” here it's people ask people, “What does Chicano means?” It means, “we see no borders.” It is a political term. And I remember in 1990 Dr. Paredes was being honored in The Valley for his name, and he was everybody was… and a little girl walked up to him and they were filming this, they walked up to him and said, “Mr. Paredes, what does Chicano mean?” He said, “It's a political term. It means that we're going to stand up for ourselves. That's what Chicano means. It means you're going to stand up, you're not going to sit down, you're going to stand up, fighting what we believe about of our people. That's what Chicano means.” This is about like a 10 year old girl, he's telling this too. And I believe that, and that started my political, being politicalized, accepting the word “Chicano,” if you notice, I use it a lot, being brown and proud, knowing your indigenous roots, knowing that your blood is from here, and part of your blood is from Europe, where you're mixed, but you're from here. So I take that part, that part of me, and I got my politicalized, and now when, even when, when, in the 70s, I was involved with Hortensia, with the boycott, the grape boycott, we organized here in Austin then we went to East Austin. And we visited all, all those people that had Gallo Wines. One time we were demonstrating down on Congress Street, picketing and the cops came, I said “Hortensia, you better get in the car, your dad would kill me if you get arrested.” And they came up to us, and because we knew our rights. You know, I think the farm workers, this was said in Supreme Court to say that we have the right to demonstrate on public not private roads. I really think that. I think our people solidified on that 14th Amendment that we have the right on public, to be able to demonstrate as long as it’s a public road. It doesn't belong to nobody. It belongs to all of us. So we are right. We can be on the sidewalk, because that's an easement created by the City of Austin or the County, gives us the right to demonstrate. I know they were beat up a lot earlier on doing the farm workers strike. That was political. But I really believe that our people created that that part of the amendment that allows us to public demonstrate, the right, you know, freedom of speech and all that. and you understand that then that cost me to get real political and get in the movement in the 70s, and then in the 70s is when I really picked it up, more than '68 or '69."

My two brothers, not literally, with my older brother, my little brother, he\nwas living next door to her, and I was a carpenter. We both were carpenters, but this is, you know, early, early November, there's not much work. I think we had just finished the strike. I belong to Union\nCorporate Local 1266 carpenters United. You know, pipe fitters and carpenters of America. It's 12, union, 1266 and I was a member of that and I was uni... I was we were both cubs who have been trained to be General Carpenters, and there was no work so we were both home. So I had $2 in my pocket. Then I had my 1962 Bell Air Chevrolet, blue Chevrolet, and I was going to go down to campus to go see a movie. The Varsity was just $1 on day time, mid time, mid day, day time. This is about close to 12 o'clock. So I visit my brother said do you wanna go he said “no, no, no, I don't want to go. I gotta stay home, clean up. Mary's gonna come out.” Said, Okay. Then I saw through to the window. I saw Hortensia next door. Said, “Hey, who's that?” “That's my neighbor. Her name is Hardy.” That's what they call her. “Well introduce me” He said “nah, nah, they’re real strict. She’s going to the university.” “Let’s go talk to her come on.” So he finally relents and we go outside and he says “Hi Hardy, this is my\nbrother Marcos.” So I walked to her, she had a purse. She had a hair cut done by clue, the movie clue. And Jane Fonda, she has a layer cut. She has same hair cut, cut that way. And I saw her purse, it said, “Who is Gonzalo Barrientos?” Because Gonzalo Barrientos was running, was thinking about running for representatives. And I knew Gonzalo we used to be neighbors back in the 60s there in South Austin. So I knew him. I said, “I know him.” She said, “oh you do you know Gonzalo?” I says, “yeah, he's thinking about running… for” “Yeah, he's, I work for Gary Guiterrez.” She said, “I'm his only secretaries. And he's, they're good friends, and he's going to support him,” and that's what ….POLITICS. Pinche politica se sabe. Right? It was politics. So we talk, and so “Where are you going?” “I have to go back to campus.” “Well, I'm going to campus. I'm going down the Varsity theater I can just drop you off.” “I don't let me ask my mom.” So she went inside and said, “Oh, it's Marcos' brother,” so “it's okay. He's going to campus”. So she we got in the car, we started talking. I parked the car, I walked her to where she's going. She said “Oh, you know, what are you hungry?” Said, “Yeah, but I'll be honest, I only have $2” “Nah, I'll buy for you” because she had a student card. So we went to the commons, you know right here. We ate, we start talking. Came out, “oh I never seen the tower.” “Oh, let me take you to the tower.” So we went to the tower. We didn't go out, we just talked. We ended up walking, talking all the way to the LBJ Library. She missed all her classes. This is like one o'clock. It's four o'clock. We're going to see the museum. We go, “Let's go to Museum.” Went to LBJ, we got the tour. She still has the original pamphlet that she brought in 1971, she kept it. She still has it. It's what, 53 years. Then I said, “You know, I have to go to work.” I also was running the very first drive by Mexican food for Los Cazulas. We had little house. He bought a little house. He rented a house, and he brang food over there, I would set it out to go drive by. Only had two tables in the whole place."

And they would come and they would trash, and they would pee in the yard, defecate, throw up, and then they would block driveways. They called the cop. The cop would say, doesn't, “you know, move, please move something” they would move. We we could have called wreckers. We didn't know that. But there was just ugly and disrespected the people. They would call us name, they call him “wet backs” and stuff like that. It was just ugly. Just the ugly people. There were nice people show up and join the races and go home, but then there were ugly people who just didn't care, you know, and it just got real bad, and we couldn't do nothing. We couldn't get a park there. We couldn't do nothing because of the boat races. We couldn't build nothing there. We couldn't put nothing up because they would tear down put fences and tear it up. So there was demonstration. And the last demonstration was in '77, they knew we were coming. It was set up. They beat up Paul. They beat up Sam. And they beat up Adela. They beat up Guerra. She was pregnant with Viria. They beat up some of the guys. And the one cop was Duplo. He hated us. He's a bad cop, real bad cop. And he finally got disciplined, but all the charges were dropped."

I worked at TJ's Hamburgers, so from 11 to two, so he told me to go and I knew why, later I knew why, they knew something's going to come down. And so I was at work when I heard they got beat up. It was a big fiasco. It was a big, big, you know, his picture is famous. It's shown all the time when the cops got him in there, and then he got nearly killed at the KKK demonstration later. \"Wait, say that again?\" the KKK demonstration that happened later, that's where he really got beat up by police. \"Who was this?\" Paul, and Adela, and Maria Limon got beat up by the cops, and film is all on video."

But going back to that part was after that happened, I went back to school and '79 and graduated, and we were asked to speak about Chicano Movement to GT students. So me and Paul went and I parked near the Frank Irwin center before it was was 70- It was '79 early, and we're walking, and he told me this other guy was gonna run for office, and I just went off. “Nah, ese otro no vale nada.” “You know that guy's not been trained by like us, if anybody ran for city council from East Township, maybe somebody who's from here. You know.” “Well he's from here,” “Ya but, yeah, but he's, he's been a professional. He's never he's never been in the trenches like we have, organizing and doing everybody and fighting for things in our neighborhood”. “I'll do it” Paul says “tu lo haces?” “Yeah, I'll run.” “Are you sure?” “Yeah, ill run. Let me run, because he's good, but he's he's going to be eaten up.” Says “alright.” It's 1979 so 1980 I ran for city council. Ran citywide, Garned, 22,000 votes. Not enough for run off, but enough to make the guy, Ron Mullen, pissed off at me, because he, they declared all the incumbents but him. Nine o'clock. And then finally, finally, nine o'clock they, everybody. By seven, all the incumbents had won except for him. And by nine o'clock, they finally called his race that he won. He was pissed, he was mad. He was real mad at me for that. And I ran on. I ran. This is how I ran. I ran for the city of Austin. You know, let me share this with you. North Austin is doing very well, this and that, and then West Austin is the best. That's where all the money is, the big homes. You know, South Austin is doing all right. That child is like they are like children. My oldest son, oldest son, oldest daughter. This boy, he's struggling, but he's all right. He's South Austin. Still needs a lot of help. But my baby, East Austin, he's really in trouble. He needs a lot of help. So we need to take\nlittle things from each one and help East Austin bring it up with the rest. That's how I talked about East Austin. The truth. We don't have sidewalks. We are the we have dumps in our neighborhood, junkyards in our neighborhood. We have some of the best, the worst schools in our neighborhood. A lot of things we have in East Austin not being done. Yet we all pay our taxes. We just want our first share. That's\nhow my political term was. It says we had a three thing, you know, and I just can't remember right now what it was. We had a poster that said it was the most was important. And it's the most important is, is\nour neighborhood, our families, but most: our children. And this didn't come from me. It came from, rest his soul, Delgado. Martin Delgado. He's the one that said, “What's most important? Marcos,” then he\nwent “hey that's a good slogan.” So we took his slogan, put it in a poster, put my picture in the poster, boom and we garnered you know this word that this that happened when, when I was in North Austin\ncampaign for city council, that guy said, “Wait a minute. It says, here you married to Hortensia Palmores for 16 years. What- Why you she not De Leon? You're De Leon?” That's, that's what happened that and I was in East, northeast Austin, in an Anglo library."

Then, for some reason, I ran for Constable. Friends of mine encourage me and I lost to Margaret. But then Hank Gonzalez, we had campaigned for him to run against Richard Moore, and we won, but then he threw us out. My biggest was Hank. My biggest campaign, free advertising was when he came to the headquarters and he got tired, he put his feet up on the desk, and then the news media showed up, and then he bought the when I walked in and let him know he took his feet off, I said, “No, leave them on. You got holes in your shoes, man.” “What?” “Leave them on.” until the camera came in, and I said, “Look, he's walked the neighborhood. He's got holes on his feet.” It made him great. It was great, you know, it was just like, perfect. He had holes on shoes, you know, like you wear because he been walking, he never took him off. But that was the best thing. But then he got elected, then he threw us out, threw the barrio people out. You know, I ran all the precinct, four precincts in the city and the county, and I had captains for every one of them. So when I got out, they left too. But he won anyway. He was terrible. So I ran against him. I told Paul I wanna run, “it's perfect. We can beat him,” I said, and this is political. When they asked him about him, “Would he win?” I said to the guy, “Yeah, but you want my political opinion or my personal opinion?” “What's your personal opinion?” “I don't like him.” “Why?” “He's the cop,\" “Well what's your political?” “He'll win.” “why?””he's the cop.” And I was proven right. He won. I knew he would a cop. I knew he would win. Police officers really get elected. They're cool. But those other part of him that we didn't know about, we find out later. And so when I ran against him, he didn't do anything. Perfect. So what I did, I took my wife to San Francisco. I have a friend of mine. Gordon Chin, who used to run the Chinese resource community resource in Chinatown. I have connections."

              "text": "Oh, my god, \"Yeah,\" you kidding? \"Yeah.\" Anyway, so I called them up and said, No, no, that's “Marcus. I put you in a hotel in Chinatown, holiday inn, $45 a night.” \"I'll take it.\" So when I took her, I told her what I wanted to do. “I'm gonna run for against Hank.” “What?” “It’s true.” I said, “We can beat him.” “It’s a lot of work.” “I know we start out now a year from now, we can beat him.” We all ran grassroots campaigns. I remember and Gordon took us, took us to eating at good places. Just fine. It was a lot. I love Chinese breakfast. Man, there's a coolest thing, like La Raza, like eating tacos, but Chinese way, you know, like good, good food! We love- Chin introduced me to chinese food, to Asian food. Chinese, Japanese. I don't ever eat that stuff, tortilla, hamburger, y ya, that's what I asked her to run for. So we ran. Ran a grass root campaign. We walked. I walked till my back, almost gave out and damageds. We walked every neighborhood. We had people help us. We had money. My father helped me. We got some money. We got good camp- We had two campaign people want to work for me, Alan Kaplan and came here with the other guy. Alan later became board director, board of trustee for AISD, I mean, for ACC and we won, by 250 votes, we beat him, and there's a picture of it. Alan said he loved working for me. We we walked every neighborhood. I walked. Jake Pickle taught me that, when when I ran once you he didn't like Hank either. He says, “I'll help you out.” And so he walked with me and watched how he walked and I will walk neighborhood, and knew what he would tell me, “This is a great community to run for office.” He says, “You're the first politician came to my house. What's your name? What do you stand for?” And I would tell him, and I would get their vote. You go where nobody went, I would tell, I went, I would go in the lion's den, so to speak, with people. And the way I knew some people voted for me, even though Hank was in front, shaking their hands when they came out, they would do this to me (winks). These are elders. And smile. I go like, don't say nothing, because Hank's right there. And that's why I knew. We won by turn some few votes. We were happy. It's a picture of me and Hortensia. Estrella remembers my kids were already getting there, nine, eight years old. It was hard. I was away at the house a lot, but grass root, you got to start a year against somebody. But also you have to, you have to have a record, because I could say what I've done. I could say what I was involved with. I could say how I got street signs put in. I could say I got parks put in. I could say I helped build some new home. I could say that people came to me and asked for help. I would help them out. I could say that because I had done it. And that's something. Who wants to run for office, but they're gonna “What are you gonna do for me?” “Well, what do you need?” “Well, I've don’t know…”. “Well, you know what? Let me call John or let me call Albert. Let me call Mary. Uh, give her a call. Tell her you talked to me. Tell her the problem is she and see if we can be if you don't get help, tell me, I'll find somebody else.” Because when you get a position like I did, you meet a lot of people like see, you know when Gordon Chin, When I saw Gordon five, six. I would go over there just just to see him. And one thing is, one of his friends told him they were telling me in Chinese, \"Oh, if he's your friend, how come you don't speak Chinese? How come he can't use, you know, chopsticks,” and he would get embarrassed. \"I'm sorry, Gordon,\" because he would get embarrassed of me. They had a big function at his house. And not only there were age, there were people from there were Taiwanese, there were Vietnamese, there were Japanese or Chinese, there were other Asians, and everybody ate con palitos. And I was sitting there and Gordon girlfriend said, “Gordon, Gordon, Marcos is not eating”. He says, “Marcus? “I said, “I need, I need a fork,\" (laughter) \"unless you have tortilla.” But that's kind of a story, but, but the side thing about going, about growing up and meeting people and and knowing when we won that race, because we live lasted four years, but we were able to do a lot in four years."

You know Asian and Asian, woman and a woman, gay, or was another gay, whatever. This is, shared identity. In the Barrio. When you grow up in your Barrio, in Chicano Barrio, it's a lot of indigenous roots in. And even though we may be Americanized a lot, but there's this thing about being very humble, of never thinking you bigger than anybody else you know. And that was a lot of Palm. There were eldery people. There people would never come when parents would come to the cafeteria to help out on different functions, on PTA nights and stuff like that. And then the janitors will always teach you, if you hear- listen to them, they will teach you to be a humble person, to give thanks what you have, those be thankful what you have. And no one's above you. No one's below you. You know, I used to tell my students, there's no\none. I saw a sign that said, “because these two is the best above the rest,” and it made me mad. So because it may because I way I grew up, there is no best of the rest. So I would tell my students, if they\nwere in the first grade, to the were seniors in high school. It says, it says there's nobody better than you, all right? There's nobody above you. There's no one below you. What you do when you get to the top is you reach your hand bring everybody beside you. So when you walk down the aisle, you walk together abreast. You don't leave no one behind, and you don't get ahead of nobody. That's what I believed in. Is I was when I was a Parent Support Specialist for AISD in '86 and I was, I work with kids and parents to bring them together. That's what I taught. That's what, I think that's what I learned from the teachers\nand the staff that work. Miss Campos, who's whose husband ran the only Tejano Music Station KVET in the 50s and 60s, she was the secretary. She worked as secretary. She will teach us that. And one\nday, she did me and my brother a favor. She said she's in the sunshine camp. We were kids, twice. We were only supposed to go one time. The first time we went, took Ernstine to it because she got late, and then took us in, even though we were not supposed to be there."

Sister Turner calls me up. “Marcus. Marcus, we got, twelve noon we got to be on 11th Street, the racist hotel.” “Dorothy, what do you mean? Racist hotel?” “That racist hotel, the building here on 11th Street, right across from our neighborhood.” “What are you talking about?” “They ain't got no windows facing East Austin” I said, “You got to be kidding me”. “Marcus, need you and Paul and Francis need to be there. The consilio needs to be there.” “Okay, Francis, we'll be there.” So we show up. It's true. If you see the east wall of the, I don't know what's called now, I think it's a good night hotel or something. It used to be the Marriott, right on 11th Street, and IH 35 the windows, there are no windows facing East Austin. You know how hotels have windows all the way around, even in New York, I was standing at a Holiday Inn, and they were head forward, and you faced another hotel. It has no windows. It was the best thing you did because in the Marriott ended up giving said job for progress, to do all the hiring. I don't know, for just said Jobs for Progress, but GI Forum was a Mexican American organization. GI Forum, the one of their businesses, is set for, set for, set for, for jobs, and they appointed them to do all the hiring isn’t that great? A Chicano organization?"

              "text": "Oh yeah. it's a lot of things that I've done. There's a lot of things- This is what I say. \"I was involved in this.\" I didn't say I did it, but my hand was there when they asked me, I'd have this thing like, what are you doing here? Marcus, I was invited. I never show up at a place that I wasn't invited. Somebody will call me. Said, \"You need to be there Marcos, this is going to happen.\" So I show up, then I get back the information. But when I have to make a decision, I don't make a decision there. They said, “Well, what is, what do you want to do about this?” “Well, let me go back to the group and I'll tell you what they want.” “But don't you control them?” “No”, “Aren’t you the leader?” I says, \"I'm a yes, I'm a leader of what they want.” A good leader is supports its followers. People follow me. People ask me to speak, because I do have a voice. I don't mind talking. You see me now, so what I tell “I'll be your voice. But what did you want?” “But you tell him,” “I'm not going to tell him if you tell me what you want.” And that's helped me. When one of my leaders had a very hard decision to make, and she was scared she didn’t know what to do, she said, “Can I take a break?” And she took me. “Marcos, I don't know-” Mira. Mira. I said, “Look, Rene, look, what is does your neighborhood want you to do?” “Well, they want us to do this.” “Then you tell the council, 'no, this is what the neighborhood wants,' if they if they change their mind, if they don't give it to you, you go back to your neighborhood and you tell them they didn't do it. So we'll go after them. But if you said, Well, if you agree what they want, then what are you going to tell your group? That you didn't do what they want you to do? You decided to compromise? So don't compromise. Just go with your fam- what your people told you to do that. That's- that's your leaders, and you're their spokesman, and you're the leader. You're the face of it.” So she went up said, “No, the neighborhood wants those lands to be marked from commercial to to single family, and that is it.” And the chief forced the vote six to one, and they voted to make that land family, single family land and their 50 owner occupied house was she talked about. That's what I learned, to stick to your to your values and be humble. Because if, if you think you're up here and you forget who you came from, that's what Palm taught me. That's what the people, people, the barrio people taught me, is to be humble, is to make sure you carry their water. Because when you carry the water, you get to drink from it. If you carry your own water, they don't drink from it, right? Because you carry your own water, you want to be who you want to be. It's not your water, it's their water. They give it to you to carry, but you can drink from it. You can get nourished from it. You can take strength from it. And that's what I grew up with, and that's what taught me that I mean, let me give you an example, how you listen to your leaders. I was at a function. I was dressed like you, with your shirt and little jacket, this sweater, black pen, politicing. This man, señor, took me, Joe Morales, Montopolis, “Mira mijo, if you gonna represent us, you gonna, you better look like the part. That's not gonna cut it. Where's your tie? Where's your coat?” “Yes, sir. Okay.” Never again did I show up looking like that. That's your leaders. That's an elder telling you what you need to do, if you're humble enough, if you listen to what he's saying, he's giving you advice. He's just trying to help you. It doesn't sound like it. Está regenando, verdad? But if you listen, they're helping you. And that's what I learned from being from Palm being from this community. And if you, those are strong leaders, they they carry the water of their people, they carry the food of their people, and what their needs are like. I used to tell the city council, I'm not here because of luxury, I'm here because of necessity, and that's the first thing I should say Council, they will say, “Marcus, you gotta control your people? Why are they cussing.” in like one time they call the City Council a bunch of bastards, racist bastards. Then I asked him, I asked the council, “Why do you think Mr. Donley is so upset that he called you that, if you stop to think, why is he so angry that he called you that?” That's part, I think, what you learn as a child. If you're humble enough that you want you need to do the other part, remember I was telling you I’m in two worlds all the time, the red world and the white world is my part of the river. It says, “Why are you angry? Why are you angry at me? Why are you angry? Why? Who did you wrong? And then somebody did you wrong. Is it your wife got mad at you, or your kid did something wrong, or your father got after you, so you're getting after me now?” and that's the teaching you get if you listen, like I said earlier that when I when I used to go to lunch, I never sat\nwith the teachers. I'll go sit with the students, and I wouldn't say nothing, but you learn a lot, if you listen."

              "text": "The way I, like I was telling Hortensia and we both agree. Anyone who drives by Palm School, who went to school there, is like, boom, it's like a beacon just lights up. \"I remember when I remember, I met my girlfriend,\" like some people, had childhood girlfriends at the school, then they got married later. I've heard those stories. They met at Palm, then they went to junior high then they went to high school, and then they got married. But that's a beacon. It's a reference of their childhood. They remember. They remember everything. Like you asking me, \"well, you remember,\" \"I remember this, I remember that, and did this. Then Ms. Menn did this to me, and Ms. Schulte did this to me.\" I think when they see the word Palm School and they see it, it's like a beacon. It's like a light that lights up in their hearts and lights and in their mind. That's why it has to be kept now, the question is, when they see Palm School and they walk in, what do they see? Being part of the Travis County Steering Committee, what we're asked, What do we want to see? I want to know what Palm, I want an alumni to come tell me. I know a lot of people want, but I went to high school. I mean, with the public school alumni, tell me when they walk in, what do they want to see? For me as a person, what I want to see when I walk in there, if I'm in from Tupelo, Mississippi, or I'm from, you know, from Boston, Massachusetts, right? Or from Cleveland, Ohio, or Seattle, Washington, or all from city of California. When I walk into school, what do I see? What I want to see is toda la fami- What I want to see, for sure, is like my brother, who served 27-25 years in the Air Force, I want to see how many veterans, how many of our men and women serve our country, someone put their lifeline, somebody went to Vietnam. You know, my brother went to Guam. He was making putting bombs to bomb Cambodia. So he's part of Vietnam, but not in a way that, you know. And I realized that, how do these veterans from Palm get to be known? Is there going to be a part? When you walk into the hall and the wall, you see all these plaques and all these people graduated, went to Palm, and they served their country. That's important to me at Palm Park when they have a pavilion or an area and they say, Well, this is named after Mr. And Mrs. Maria and Juan Gonzalez. They lived on East 3rd Street, and their children went to Palm. Oh, they came to Palm. Oh, this building near this, this play scape, is named after the Gonzalez family, the Cortez family. That's what I want, because this is we're gentrified. Me and Hortensia we have a house there on Canterbury and Chalmers Street in the Barrio, still one of the very few people, but soon we'll be gone. So the building in the point the park is the only legacy we have with the Mexican- if you go to mission, Texas, Mission District in San Francisco, it's all totally gentrified. And there something was happening there is happing here, where a lot of the homes are not the same when people walk in. Two I did a short poem that day, my mother, my grandmother, and my uncle died. The poem reads like “I go to my Barrio en la calle cuatro 4th street and my grandmother's house, where my uncle live, is a two story, dark house. So today, my grandmother and my uncle died because whatever memories I have of them is gone.” So if we're gone from the Barrio, and there's some building there that many of us went to school there and lived our life there, fell in love in that school. Were influenced by people. And from there, we went to different we went all over the country, all over the state, all over the county. For me, my link is not very much. My thread doesn't go very far. It goes here, Lemon street ,Canterbury, to Airport Boulevard, to there, and it comes back to the Barrio. And then I go here before the State, I was probation officer, assistant. So I'm a professional job. I was a college advisor for almost 20 years. I was an elected official, you know? So where, so, where do you put that here? You know? So, you know, where do how many elected officials? They went to Palm graduated became elected officials. I know two me and Jerry Jones. You know for sure. I don't know anybody else. They're probably more, but I don't know. So what? What is that? What is going to be in there? Is going to be all artifacts and a couple of bones, of Mexican bones that really were Indians. I don't know. Or is it going to be something when people walk in there, a learning center, a teaching center, and also knowing the people who, who are hidden, who walk the who walk this path and these house contribute to the city, to this county, to the state and to this country. And I know we have people who did that and that, to me, that's important anybody as we lose as the Barrio becomes all white, okay, that- that's happening. You can see, look at Rainey? My brother, he freaked out. My older brother,\nwhen he saw Rainey, yeah, they're 15 tall buildings on this little piece of land. It teaches you, how does you want to look in your friend? New York? You've ever been to Manhattan? Here's a mini me in Manhattan. A mini me because I've been to Manhattan, I've been to New York, I've been to all over New York. I've spent- been there eight times, you know, I know how everything's, you know, and it's a little bitty island, so, yeah, but what happens to the center? What happens to the Palm School building? This is why it's important as Steering Committee reaches out to the alumni and other people get their ideas so we can finalize something that, because the final rests on the Commissioners Court and the architect, and then the concept was doing, gather all these ideas, see how they, get them all together, and present something to the- but so we need to give ideas to the Commissioners Court. What's important for us as alumni, we would like to see inside that building."
